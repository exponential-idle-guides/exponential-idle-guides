These guides are designed to help you play through the Theories sections
of Exponential Idle.

If you don't want to have spoilers for the later game, don't read
further ahead than you are already.

This introduction will give you some fundamentals to help you progress
while playing this section of the game.

### Graduation Routing
When within ee5 of the graduation, turn off autoprestige. It is faster
to cruise than recover and push. Best bet is use the Graduation
calculator on the [Phi*Tau Sheet]. Please [contribute to the Phi*Tau]
sheet before graduating.

### Student use routing
All routing below assumes you buy **all** available theories unless
explicitly stated because theories are important to start as soon as
possible as they function outside of the main game.

Use the [star calculator] (by Niedzielan, AfuroZamurai, and Milla) and
[student calculator] (by Eaux Tacous#1021).

For a closer calculation based on your star count use the calculator above.

★: Star count

★🗲: Star count with acceleration (x2.85)

\\(f(t)\\) | ★ | ★🗲
---        | ---            | ---
ee5k       | 1.38M          | 3.94M
ee5.5k     | 1.67M          | 4.76M
ee6k       | 1.99M          | 5.67M
ee6.5k     | 2.33M          | 6.65M
ee7k       | 2.70M          | 7.72M
ee7.5k     | 3.10M          | 8.86M
ee8k       | 3.53M          | 10.1M
ee8.5k     | 3.99M          | 11.4M
ee9k       | 4.47M          | 12.8M

### Theory Routing
Publications are equivalent to prestiges for \\(f(t)\\) so don't be afraid to
use them. However, the best publication multiplier is not known at the
time, but it does decrease over time. If you are close to a multiplier
you want, turn off autobuyer and let \\(\rho\\) increase without buying
upgrades for a faster short-term increase before the publication (turn
on after you publish). Total \\(τ\\), found in the equation or at the top
of the screen, is a multiplicative combination of all \\(τ\\) from each
theory.

Don’t be afraid to skip getting all milestones to work on the next or a
better theory.

### Respecing students
The button at the bottom labeled “Respec” removes all used \\(σ\\) in
Research and gives you back without consequence. This allows for testing
or reallocating easily. On the bottom right is located a list-shaped
button. Pressing this will reveal the <kbd>-</kbd> buttons. These
<kbd>-</kbd> buttons remove x levels from the selected research option.
The amount of levels removed is based on the x1, x10, x25, x100, xMax
cost option selected in the top right. On the right side of each
research option, you can also see the total levels.

### Respecing milestones
Unlike students, all Milestone sections already have the <kbd>-</kbd> button.
This works in the same way as above. Here you can also find how many
unused Milestones available at the top. On the right side of each
Milestone, you can also find the current and max levels of each.
