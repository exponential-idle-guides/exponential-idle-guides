### Sigma

Sigma is the number of students. E.g. "I have 300 sigma" means I have 300 total students. "Graduate every 5 sigma" means to graduate every 5 students. Denoted as \\(\sigma \\) in the game.

### Tau

Tau, formatted in the game as \\(\tau\\), is the main currency gained from doing theories. Tau is used to increase $F(t)$.

### Rho

Rho, formatted in the game as \\(\rho\\), is also a currency gained from doing theories. However, rho is reset upon publication. In fact for most theories, the $\tau$ in a theory is simply the maximum rho ever reached in that theory.

### Publication / Pub

Publication/Pub is the act of resetting theories to accumulate higher total multipliers. Higher multipliers allow us to reach higher $\rho$ and $\tau$ in the future. In England Publication is also a place where people can socialise and drink (joke).

### Dot

rhodot, taudot, qdot, (formatted as \\(\dot\rho\\), \\(\dot\tau\\), and \\(\dot{q}\\)) or any other variable with 'dot' at the end signify the rate of change of the variable, usually every second. For example, if rhodot = 3, this usually means that rho is increasing by 3 every second.

### Milestone

In theories, milestones are upgrades to aspects of theory equations. They are unlocked when your maximum $\rho$ reach certain points. Milestones persist through publications. Furthermore, for most theories you can allocate milestone points to different milestone combinations.

### Distribution

Distribution refers to the current $\tau$ amounts of all of your theories. So, in a conversation, someone might ask:

> "What's your distribution?"
>
> "My distribution is 564 486 552 635 856 902 531 470."

This means that their Theory 1 is at e564 $\tau$, Theory 2 at e486 $\tau$, and so on with Theory 8 at e470 $\tau$.

### Distribution Overpushing

A strategy to do theories that have high publication multipliers first to accumulate more students. We then use these extra students on theories that benefit more from having more students. See [overpushing](/guides/advanced-concepts/distribution-overpushing).

### Graduation / Grad

A prestige layer, which resets most variables except $\tau$. Graduations allow accumulation of more students, increasing $\tau$ rates through increased R9 power.

### Supremacy / Sup

Another prestige layer lower than graduation. This resets most variables also. It is mainly used to accumulate enough $\psi$ to buy supremacy upgrades.

### Psi

A currency gained from performing supremacies. Usually written as \\(\psi \\). It is used to buy supremacy upgrades.

### Phi

A currency gained from spending students on student upgrades. Usually written as \\(\varphi \\). It is used to boost $F(t)$ or boost theory rates.

### R9

Refers to the 9th Research of the student upgrades in the <kbd>students</kbd> tab, which is the research upgrade below theories. This research boosts theory rates significantly. You start the game with '0r9' (0 levels). The maximum is '3R9', which means you have all 3 levels of the upgrade.

### R9 swapping

A strategy where you keep your students in 3R9 for 99.99% of the time, swapping to other researches to increase $\varphi$ and $F(t)$, then prestige. This allows us to gain the benefit of having 3R9 AND higher $F(t)$ at the same time.

### Strategy / Strat

Usually refers to theory strategies. A strategy might refer to the order at which theory variables are bought, or which ones are autobought and which ones to ignore.

### Active and Idle

Usually referred in context of strategies. An active strategy requires more attention and manual variable buying, but has a higher potential $\tau$/hour gains.

### Hard Strat

Strategies that are considered 'super active' and/or hard to execute by the majority of players. This may be because of specific buy timings or requiring constant attentions. Examples of hard strategies include [T3<span style="color:#41AD21">Play2</span>](https://exponential-idle-guides.netlify.app/guides/theory-strategies/#t3play2) and [T8<span style="color:#41AD21">PlaySolarSwap</span>](https://exponential-idle-guides.netlify.app/guides/theory-strategies/#t8playsolarswap).

### Milestone Swapping / MS

The act of swapping milestones, usually in the middle of a publication. This is usually part of a super active strategy. If done correctly, it can significantly boost $\tau$/hour. This type of strategy is most common prior to reaching all milestones in a theory, with a notable exception of [T8<span style="color:#41AD21">PlaySolarSwap</span>](https://exponential-idle-guides.netlify.app/guides/theory-strategies/#t8playsolarswap), which continues using milestone swapping past full milestones.

### Doubling Variables / Doublings

Usually referred to theory variables that are multiplied by 2 or more each time you buy (Variables with $2^x$). Can sometimes refer to a really powerful variable. An example of a doubling variable is \\(q_2\\) in Theory 4.

### mod10 Variables

A lot of the variables increase their values in a stepwise function, with modulus 10 increments. See [Stepwise Variables](https://exponential-idle-guides.netlify.app/guide-extensions/stepwise-variables/).

### Doubling strats / d strats

A subset of strategies that usually involve buying mod10 variables at 1/10th of the cost of a doubling variable. These strategies usually perform admirably for most theories.

### Pub multi

A short-hand of Publication Multiplier. Usually refer to the current increase in the total multiplier when you publish. For example, most theories in the publication tab will have texts that say <kbd>Reset theory upgrades and currencies to multiply your income by xxxx</kbd>. Pub multi is the 'xxxx' number.

### Total multi

This is the number underneath the pub multi number above. It is the total multiplier of all your publications in that theory. It is dependent on both your progress in the theory and on the amount of students you have.

### CT, WSP, SL, EF, CSR2/CS2, FI, FP

Custom Theories

- Weierstraß Sine Product
- Sequential Limits
- Euler's Formula
- Convergents to Square Root 2
- Frac­tional In­teg­ra­tion
- Fractal Patterns

These are the 6 current official custom theories. More custom theories will eventually be released, and we will update this portion of the guide when they do so.

### Coasting

The act of not buying variables and letting theories reach its publication point. This is usually done when your publication multiplier is close to where you want to publish. For example, you might start coasting at 2.0 multiplier with the intention to publish at 2.5 multiplier.

### Acceleration / Accel

Refers to the usage of the acceleration upgrade. It speeds up $F(t)$ gains through increasing $\varphi$ and artificially speeding up time (by temporarily increasing \\(dt\\)). However it does not affect theories. The equation used in-game for acceleration is \\(Acceleration = (9t+1)^{1/9}\\), where \\(t\\) is the number of seconds the acceleration button is held for. To reduce the potential for player abuse, acceleration resets after being held for 1 hour, at \\(3.17x\\).

### LB

LB (usually in the lowercase form "lb") is a short hand for "leaderboard". Both the iOS and Android versions have built-in leaderboards, which can be accessed through the settings menu. There are built-in leaderboard for max $F(t)$ and for the best times in each difficulty of every minigame.

There's also a [player-updated spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VlHgt1y4GWCDph3zPfsm2foX40NK5aM0IUfZlEgy_ac/edit#gid=0) with more leaderboards, including the highest known values that have been reached for each theory among many other statistics.
