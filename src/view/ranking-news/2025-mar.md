## March 2025
New author again! Playsprout (invalid-user) here to talk about the hax :)
### News
Two new CTs have come out since the last newsletter - Basel Problem (BaP) and Magnetic Fields (MF). Basel problem deals with the famous math problem of the same name - the Basel Problem, which is the sum of the reciprocals of squares (coming out to pi^2/6). Magnetic fields deals with a solenoid and a charged particle moving due to magnetic forces. Both are really fun official theories (albeit slower than RZ and FP) and you should absolutely check them out if you haven't! 
### Rankings

1. (+0) birrel69 (?) - ee108002:
> After a large community push, finally Gilles was able to use the 64 bytes Google Play gives to fully get distribution data from all players - and guess what? Birrel is actually legitimate!
> 
> His distribution is incredibly cracked, with 750+ T3, 700+ T2, and maxed SL, EF, and FP (and likely RZ now, last we checked the dist was in January, when the update that allowed for player dist checks came out). You can see birrel distribution from 2 months ago here:
> 
> ![birrel image](/images/birrel.png)
> 
> That aside, given his 670 T2, he’s not as overpushed as his main rival d4 - and d4 could actually catch birrel in a few years due to the overpush cash-in cycle (similarly true for a lot of players in the top 20). However, for the moment, birrel safely has 1st place with over 108k (especially with the new CTs, where he doesn’t need the guide to be OP)! 
2. (+1) AbsoPerf (absoperf) - ee106695:
> Another really cracked player, but he’s been on the lb for a while as well and is for sure legit - he’s even active on discord (same username, it’s just absoperf). Yet again, he’s barely overpushed, but after joining the discord, he’s been fairly active and has a great future in exponential idle ahead of him. His rise continues! (He’s completed 4 CTs, the first 4 CT completion ever). He was also the first to max out RZ, so congratulations to him!
3. (-1) VintageSurfer56606 (?) - ee106234:
> I don’t think he’s in the discord anymore - I can’t find his ping and he even stopped being active a few months ago. Nonetheless, he’s just been going up consistently, staying in the top 3. It looks like the rise of AbsoPerf is a considerable threat to him, but he can probably hold out in the top 3 given his consistently good gains. 
4. (+1) IntellectualPower112 (NGZ001) - ee106061:
> As usual, Mr. Optimal is being Mr. Optimal. Not much to say here - his minigame stars domination continues (but d4 could be a threat to it), and his CTs remain incredibly impressive. He’s clearly doing well even with the new CTs, but he isn’t as active on the discord anymore. 
5. (+6) BlackSeal94 (blackseal94) - ee105748:
> Blackseal, more commonly known as “haxseal” has continued his incredible rise - he’s gone from under 20 to 11 to 6, and is not stopping anytime soon! He has been maintaining fairly high CTs on top of having 800 T3 (!), and is clearly doing well even with the new CTs released. It also helps that he has one of the most hax sleep schedules in existence - he doesn’t need an exalarm because he is the exalarm. He’s not been active on the discord for the last 2 weeks, but he was fairly active before that. 
6. (+1) Melv0r (Melv0r) - ee105285:
> He’s picked up activity on the discord again, and seems to be doing pretty well for himself. His WSP in particular is quite impressive, just barely beating NGZ’s 1280 WSP on a main save, making him the biggest WSP seen on a main save up until now. T1 is also impressive with e760 (again the highest on a main save so far!). And ever since he’s been active on the server (at least 1 week now), he’s also started with overpush T2, so he might fall a few ranks - but expect him to remain strong, even with his unimpressive MF and BaP so far.
> 
> He’s also managed to make it to #3 on the leaderboard of leaderboards in the lb sheet out of absolutely nowhere 👀 due to his very high theories (T1 and WSP especially, as said before, but he’s top 9 on T5, T8, T1, T3, and T4 as well), and he’s even ahead of leaderboard veterans like snaeky and NGZ001 - but I’m not surprised by this. There are a lot of players out there in the top 30 who have lb-worthy theories who aren’t on the discord, and as they join, we could see some incredible/unexpected pop-ups on the leaderboard sheet. I greatly look forward to this!
7. (+2) ReckonCrew (?) - ee105229:
> Not much of an update from the last newsletter. He’s been fairly consistent so far, and is not on the discord (or at least not active) so we don’t have any major updates from him. 
8. (+0) nubestlol (nubest) - ee105126:
> nub being nub as usual - her haxolotl strats and semi-idle play have let her remain consistently at #7, even surpassing Playspout (tbf Playspout semi-retired, something that will be covered later). As usual, she likes to call everyone hax (especially snaeky), and as usual she’s sending her Krisu and cat emojis. She also likes to use the bap lizard emoji for BaP, and has also gone mildly crazy (I mean she always was).
> 
> Anyway, let’s not turn this into a psychoanalysis of nub and instead talk about her progress again - she’s clearly doing well in the new CTs too, being in the top 5 for Basel Problem, and even having a very high RZ. While she isn’t rising at the moment, she has been making slow and steady gains on the leaderboard (or at least remaining consistent) and is bound to remain in the top 10 for the foreseeable future. 
9. (+17) HumongousTrollz273 (?) - ee104592:
> Yeah I don’t know what happened to them. They went to 18th, fell to 26th, and are now in 8th. I feel like they could be a candidate for RZ bug, but there’s no good way to confirm this anymore now that multiple people have maxed out RZ. They also aren’t on the discord so we can’t ping them either. 
10. (+7) SirIonnes (?) - ee104201:
> The new person from the last newsletter rose up again! Not sure what’s going on with sudden new players popping up and rising, but maybe it’s because of the new CTs, so the leaderboard isn’t stable yet, or maybe it could be because the greedy players are currently ahead of the overpush players (overpush pays out in the long run, not immediately). We can’t really know unless we check the dist - something that is only done if there’s suspicion of cheating. 
11. (+16) NeirinD (?) - ee103912:
> Another new player? Ok now this is just feeling weird. Again, it’s probably because leaderboards aren’t stable, and maybe they will fall back down, but these random appearances confuse me. 
12. (+11) Fireburner80 (Gull Dewcat) - ee103833:
> I think last we checked, fireburner is legit (his save got fixed after the CT 4x bug), so maybe his gains are just because of greedy + good CT pushing. Fireburner was in the top 20 (without the RZ bug) before at some point before going under top 20, but looks like he’s back up here with the releases of MF and BaP. He’s also on the discord (he became active around the time season 2 came out and actually ended up doing pretty well there, ending in position 12)
13. (+6) MuddyJackal4786 (Cryptostorm) - ee103811:
> We did actually have some suspicions about this player after some weird rises back in October (huge kudos to Jooo for keeping track of the f(t) leaderboard every day!), but we checked his dist and it’s legit. His dist is below:
> 
> ![jackal image](/images/jackal.png)
> 
> ![jackal image 2](/images/jackal2.png)
> 
> His dist is fairly strong, and yet again, not very overpushed, but there isn’t anything unusual other than the 680 tau EF (!), which came as quite a surprise because it’s the highest ever seen in a main save. Nonetheless, based on discussions, d4 sim (which is hugely helpful, so kudos to him too), and theory simulator, we can confirm that he is legit, just with a weird updating schedule and somewhat weird CT dist.
14. (+29) SendTokensTil19 (?) - ee103619:
> He was at 43 in January… and is now in position 14? We had some suspicions, but he is legit:
> 
> ![tokens image](/images/tokens.png)
> 
> I guess he just made some gains by being good at RZ/MF/BaP? It’s unclear how he’s managed to rise from 43 to 14 in 2 months (from January 1), but he has been rising over the last year, so maybe he’s just… good. Or maybe his f(t) was underpushed or maybe he just has a poor update schedule. We will never know because he’s not on the discord either ;-;
15. (+13) EdgeOfDreams (edgeofdreams) - ee103400:
> He was in the top 20, but dropped out. But he is active again and rising, showing his prowess by placing in 3rd place in Season 2. He has a strong future ahead of him, and I’m not surprised he’s made it back to the top 20, given that he was in the top 20 at some point before, and is back to playing at least somewhat actively, and is decently active on the discord. 
16. (-4) dragmehomenow (balatro ash) - ee103316:
> Finally, we are back to seeing leaderboard veterans. Dragmehomenow has consistently maintained in position 10-18 for a while now, and seems to be on track to remain around here for a while. He seems to be doing fairly well with the new CTs and is somewhat active on the discord too. 
17. (-3) SnaekySnacks (snaeky) - ee103231:
> I think we know snaeky very well at this point. He’s active on the discord, plays theories actively, overpushes, and has done well on the new CTs as well, especially Basel Problem (BaP). He’s maintained consistently around this position, but has a pretty significant time advantage over the greedy players due to overpush (and is also playing fairly well overall too). Expect him to rise to glory!
> 
> Also on a side note, congratulations to him for becoming a moderator on the exponential idle server. 
18. (-5) hotab (hotab1) - ee103086:
> Classic haxab being hax. Not much to say here, as he has just been consistent for a while - but he is in denial about being hax even though he totally is. 
> That aside, he’s also doing well with the new CTs and is also overpushing, so expect him to rise over the next few years as well (and in fact, he has been on the rise despite the drop from the last newsletter). 
19. (-3) d4Nf6Bg5 (d4Nf6Bg5) - ee102937:
> He’s barely clinging on to the top 20, but the reason for that is that 1) he’s doing FI for some reason instead of the new CTs, likely because he wants to recover to max with FI and max FP (he couldn’t max FP because he was focused on season 1) and RZ, but expect him to rise once he pushes MF and BaP, and especially once he starts cashing in from overpush in a few years. He’s pushing to 750 T2 and also plays incredibly actively. He really proved his power by destroying everyone in seasons and getting 1st place by over a day advantage, so he is truly a rising star who will eventually overtake us all, including birrel, in about 5-10 years once his overpush cycle is finished.
> 
> Huge kudos to him for making his theory simulation where you can see what to push to gain max advantage from overpush. You can find the link to it on the exponential idle discord server. 
20. (-2) seraphya (?) - ee102900:
> After they made it to top 20, they seem to have stayed there consistently. No other updates at the moment because they aren’t on the discord and haven’t shown anything unusual on the leaderboard either. 
25. (-16) Playspout (Playspout) - ee102193:
> Nooooo… :(
> 
> He semi-retired and plays idle now and doesn’t seem to be pushing the new CTs (not even pushing RZ much). He’s even falling on the leaderboard sheet, but he’s still #1 on the leaderboard of leaderboards because he dominated the leaderboard for 2+ years.
> 
> But he did place in the top 10 in the seasons, so I guess there’s that. 
33. (-13) xtevenx3 (Xteven) - ee100946:
> Unfortunately he seems to have really fallen off since the new MF/BaP update. Maybe it’s just because he isn’t updating very often, maybe it’s because of something else, but he’s not very active on the discord either.

Banned. (-infinity) Eijarisen:
> Turns out he seems to have timeskipped a lot (15 years!), so he got banned from the leaderboard for that reason.
> 
> ![eija image](/images/eija.png)
> 
???. (-???) ItsNotMe109:
> Why can’t I find them on the leaderboard anymore? They just… vanished from it some time between March 19 and March 24. 
### Honorable mentions:
23. (+12) Hackzzz118 (hacker118) - ee102665:
> He’s on the rise and could reach top 20 soon. His CTs are great (especially he was super competitive on RZ and is now good at MF and BaP as well) and his regular theories are good too. Expect greatness from him as he’s haxxxx!

Python’s Koala:
> Congratulations to him for getting 2nd place in seasons and getting the moral victory by not doing exalarm ;)
> 
> He’s also active on the server and is gaining up the leaderboards, but he’s nowhere near the top, only at 92k.
> 
> On a side note, he also creatted BaP so kudos to him for that too, it's a great theory.

Mathis:
> Thank you for making Magnetic Fields, it's a great theory and the season was great too.

Eylanding: 
> Congratulations on becoming a new mod! I know you’re going to be hugely helpful in resolving conflicts and running seasons. Common Eylanding W

Jooo:
> Again, kudos to him for maintaining leaderboard records all the way from 2022 - we can now see any suspicious players much more easily.
